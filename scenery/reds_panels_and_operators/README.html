		<h3>
			<u>How to Use / Best Practices:</u>
		</h3>
		<ol style="line-height: 1.7;">
			<li><b>Choose a panel</b> you would like to use, and place it in an empty area where you can build it (do not yet place it where you want it to go).
				<ol>
					<li>Double click the panel to <b>open</b> up <b>entity settings</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Choose</b> desired panel and mount <b>colors</b> (if applicable).</li>
					<li><b>Select</b> if you would like <b>to hide</b> any of the optional components (like the mount, etc.). They will not disappear in the editor, but will disappear in Play Mode.</li>
					<li><b>Select</b> what <b>texture</b> you would like to use for the panel. Again, this will only apply in Play Mode.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Choose an operator</b> you would like to add to the panel and place it near the panel.
				<ol>
					<li>Double click the operator to <b>open</b> up <b>entity settings</b>.</li>
					<li>(<i>Optional</i>) Give it a name. This may be tedious, but will keep your operators organized for easy editing and will greatly help if you run into any errors in Play Mode.</li>
					<li><b>Change the position</b> settings to <b><i>exactly</i> match</b> the X,Y,Z coordinates of the panel you placed earlier. This should perfectly align the operator to the panel (except for main panels, which also need the X rotation set to -70 and manual alignment; see <a href="https://youtu.be/Iw8XG1mUMP0" target="_blank">this tutorial video</a> for how to make this easy).</li>
					<li><b>Adjust position</b> of the operator on the panel as desired.</li>
					<li>Like the panel, <b>choose any customization settings</b> you would like for the operator. Operators also have a "Function" setting. Hover your cursor over any of the settings' options for details on what it does.</li>
					<li>If you get an <b>error</b> during play mode, <b>read it carefully</b>; you likely forgot to set the block option if using a Function other than "None". Otherwise, please report the bug if possible.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Repeat Step 2</b> to fully build out your custom panel composition.</li>
			<li>Once completed, <b>select</b> your whole composition and <b>press <code>CTRL+C</code> to copy</b> it.</li>
			<li>Use the <b>"Click Paste" tool</b> under the "Scenery" tab to paste it near its final location.</li>
			<li>While the whole composition is selected, use the <b>"Rotate" tool</b>, along with the <b>basic movement tools</b>, to finely position your custom panel to its <b>final location</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Repeat</b> as desired to place multiple similar, or unique, panels around your ride, and you're basically done! üòÑ</li>
		</ol>
		<ul><li>As a final note, it might be good to not delete your original "master" panels until you are completed with your build, just in case you need another copy or you want to modify it. Modifying already moved / rotated panels is a <em>pain</em>!!!</li></ul>

		<h3>
			<u>Known Issues:</u>
		</h3>
		<ul style="line-height: 1.5;">
			<li>"Auto-alignment" via coordinates doesn't work for Main Panels, because they are at an angle. The best practice, in my opinion, is to align one operator by hand, and then copy it's coordinates to other operators you want to add, and adjust from there. This makes aligning any additional operators much easier.</li>
			<li>"Trains in Service" Mode for Key Switch operators will display the key animation when it shouldn't the first time the ride is put into "Manual Block" Mode. I'm not really sure how to fix this, because it seems like NL2 is miscalculating the number of lashed trains upon entering "Manual Block" Mode for the first time.</li>
			<li>A LOT of stuff was copy and pasted from object to object. PLEASE let me know if there are any typos or if settings/options are mislabeled.</li>

		</p>
		<p>
			<u>No worries! Here's an easy break down to help you meet the requirements:</u> üòä<br>
			<ul style="line-height: 2;">
				<li>First off, a great summary of what you can and can't do with the pack <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</li>
				<li>
					You are totally free to use this pack in any of your parks that you plan to share with other people (ie. Steam Workshop, forums, etc.)<br>
					<b>as long as you...</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep the <code>LICENSE</code> file in-tact and present within the pack's files.</li>
						<li>This includes when you package the park into a <code>.nl2pkg</code> file (however, the SCOs should automatically package it with them, so no worries about having to do it manually).</li>
						<li>Crediting the pack and the author in your project or project's description is not <i>technically</i> required by the license, but is greatly appreciated.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The license requires that all source code must be disclosed and available. That <i>technically</i> means locked/encrypted <code>.nl2pkg</code>'s break the license. <b>However</b>, I am willing to ignore this requirement <b>as long as the pack and author are properly credited</b>, visible outside of the locked package.</li>
				<li>You may modify and improve any part of the pack you would like, as long as the license stays in-tact and changes remain available to the public. <b>This includes locked/encrypted <code>.nl2pkg</code>'s</b>; meaning, no, modified works of this package are not allowed to be encrypted! If you have an addition you would like made to the original pack to be used in a private park, please feel free to contact me and I will gladly look into adding it.</li>
				<li>Lastly, you can <i>technically</i> redistribute modified versions of this pack if you really want to, but I would much rather prefer you provide improvements to me so I can incorporate them into the official/original pack. You will be be credited too! I promise! üòâ
